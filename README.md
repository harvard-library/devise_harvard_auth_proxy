# Devise Harvard AuthProxy

A Devise plugin to support Rails authentication via AuthZProxy

## Dev Notes

Supports Rails 3.x and 4.x.

On Rails 4.x, depends on [activerecord-deprecated_finders](https://github.com/rails/activerecord-deprecated_finders).  
Since gemspecs don't allow for conditional dependencies, you'll need to include that Gem in your application's Gemfile.
